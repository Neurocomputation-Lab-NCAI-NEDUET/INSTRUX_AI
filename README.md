# INSTRUX_AI

**All the notebooks were created on Colab**


**U_new(1).ipynb**

This is the most recent file the dataset used in this file is "data_2023-01-30 09_22_13_2023-02-07 20_42_17 (1).csv", I've experimented multiple approaches with it, first I created a model with TimeSeriesGenerator but it didn't work and then I created window dataset.  



**Instrux_data_visualization (1).ipynb**

This notebook contains hourly data that was downloaded from the Report Section of the Instrux website for the period of 2022-11-01 to 2022-12-30.



**INSTRUX_Naive_Forcasting (1).ipynb**

This notebook was used to identify the mae and mse, I've used it just for the learning purpose. 



**INSTRUX_DATA_(1).ipynb**

I've used instrux_3.csv in this notebook, with this notebook we've got some results which wasn't satisfactory but we can make it better by hyperparameter tuning. 
Note:there's mistake in the notebook, where ever you find MegaWatt in the notebook its actually Energy.



**EXPERIMENTATION_INSTRUX.ipynb**

This notebook tells you how to use RNN, I've used it for the learning purpose only.
